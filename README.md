# J5E
If by some chance you see this, I'm just simply learning about game engines following [this tutorial](https://pikuma.com/courses/cpp-2d-game-engine-development). So far it's been really great, and I'd recommend it. It's by no means a real game engine so far, so don't critisize it too harshly, but minor recommendations are welcomed. However, one thing I'm wondering about that I can't seem to find good resources on is android portability, like how unity or godot can just simply export your game to apk and it just happens like that. If anyone has any reccomendations for learning how to do that process please let me know! Also I'm terrible with coming up with names so if anyone has any ideas for something better than J5E, do also let me know that as well!
