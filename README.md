If by some chance you see this, I'm just simply learning about game engines following [this tutorial](https://pikuma.com/courses/cpp-2d-game-engine-development). So far it's been really great, and I'd recommend it. It's by no means a real game engine so far, so don't critisize it too harshly, but minor recommendations are welcomed. However, one thing I'm wondering about that I can't seem to find good resources on is android portability, like how unity or godot can just simply export your game to apk and it just happens like that. If anyone has any reccomendations for learning how to do that process please let me know!
